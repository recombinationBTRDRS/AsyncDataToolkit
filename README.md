# AsyncDataToolkit

## Overview

**AsyncDataToolkit** is an asynchronous data processing toolkit that allows seamless importing, validating, analyzing, transforming, and exporting of structured data. It supports input formats like Excel, CSV, JSON, as well as external API sources.

## Workflow

1. **Data Upload**  
   Users can upload files directly or initiate a data fetch from an API.

2. **Format Detection**  
   The tool automatically identifies the data format and processes it accordingly.

3. **Data Import**  
   The input is transformed into an internal representation for structured handling.

4. **Column Preview & Formatting Options**  
   Users can review detected columns and optionally adjust formatting.

5. **Validation**  
   The system performs content validation. Errors are clearly reported to the user for correction.

6. **Optional Skipping of Formatting**  
   Users may skip detailed formatting and proceed with default column interpretations.

7. **Action Selection**  
   Choose one or more data operations: _Analyze_, _Transform_, or _Visualize_.

8. **Processing**  
   Executes the selected operation(s) asynchronously and efficiently.

9. **Representation (Optional)**  
   If visualization is chosen, the system generates charts or other summary views.

10. **Result Delivery**  
    Users can preview the output in-browser or download the results.

11. **Export Format Selection**  
    Supports exporting data to Excel, CSV, JSON, or via an API endpoint.

## Key Features

- Asynchronous processing for high-performance workflows
- Multi-format input/output support (Excel, CSV, JSON, APIs)
- Step-by-step validation and custom column configuration
- Optional data visualization layer for insight generation

## Use Cases

Designed for data analysts, ETL engineers, and developers working with dynamic datasets. Ideal for automating tedious preprocessing and enabling rapid experimentation.
